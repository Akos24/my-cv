                <h1>My Goals</h1>
                <p>I have always liked coding and styling. In the last 2 years, I really got into studying coding and web design, and I love it. My current goal is to be a full-stack web developer, and I am studying for that goal every single morning.</p>
                <h1>My Motivation</h1>
                <p>I am motivated for this work because I feel like this is my purpose. Every time I'm studying coding, web design, computer networking, etc., I am in a flow state because I just love learning and creating. If there are days where I don't feel the spark in myself, I check my goals to clearly see what I'm working towards and then discipline myself for the task.</p>
                <h1>My Character</h1>
                <p>I have lots of interests in this world. Besides my passion for coding and designing, I have a high interest in exercising, running, and doing sports activities in general. I am an extroverted, socially active person. I am also highly self-analytical, so I can be aware of my ambitions but also my mistakes. I think great mental and physical health are needed to be able to set big goals.</p>
